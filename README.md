# Guessing Games: Hangman Game & Which Number

A Python guessing game program. 

The word or the number to guess is sorted by the program. The player should suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the player loses a point.

If the word or the number is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. On the other hand, if the player makes enough incorrect guesses to complete the hanged man stick figure, the game is also over, this time with the player losing.
